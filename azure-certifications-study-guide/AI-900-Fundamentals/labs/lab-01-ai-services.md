# Lab 01: Explore Azure AI Services

## 🎯 Lab Goal

Get familiar with the **Azure AI Services** experience using the portal (and optionally Azure AI Studio) without writing code. You’ll:

- See where the main AI services live
- Try a simple demo for vision or language
- Understand what’s possible at a high level

This is perfect for AI‑900, which focuses on concepts and basic usage.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Azure subscription (free trial is enough)
- Web browser

No coding required.

---

## Step 1 – Find Azure AI in the Portal

1. Sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the search bar, type **"AI services"**.
3. Note the categories you see:
	- Vision (image/video understanding)
	- Language (text understanding)
	- Speech (speech‑to‑text, text‑to‑speech)
	- Document Intelligence (forms/invoices)

Take a screenshot or short note of the services that exist – you’ll see them again in later labs.

## Step 2 – Open Azure AI Studio

1. Go to [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com).
2. Select your subscription and region.
3. Explore the **Get started** or **Playgrounds** area.

Look for tiles like:

- "Build a chat copilot"
- "Analyze images"
- "Extract text from documents"

You don’t need to configure everything – just see what’s available.

## Step 3 – Try a Simple Vision Demo

1. In Azure AI Studio or the classic Cognitive Services demo pages, find an **image analysis** demo.
2. Upload a picture (e.g., from your computer or a sample image from Microsoft).
3. Observe the output:
	- Generated **description** (caption)
	- **Tags** like "person", "building", "outdoor"
	- Any **detected objects**

Take note of:

- How accurate the description is
- Any limitations (e.g., struggles with small text or unusual scenes)

---

## Step 4 – Try a Simple Language Demo

1. Find a demo for **text analysis** or **sentiment analysis**.
2. Paste in a short review, for example:
	- "The support team was very helpful and the app works great!"
3. Observe:
	- Detected **sentiment** (positive/negative/mixed)
	- Any **key phrases** or entities it highlights

Try a more negative review and compare results.

## Step 5 – Summarize What You Learned

In your own words (1–2 paragraphs):

- What types of problems can Azure AI Services help solve?
- Which service (Vision, Language, Speech, Document Intelligence) seems most useful for your work or interests?

You can jot this down in a notes file or at the bottom of this markdown file (for yourself).
