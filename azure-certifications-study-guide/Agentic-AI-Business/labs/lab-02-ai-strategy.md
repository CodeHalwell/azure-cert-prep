# Lab 02: Defining an AI Strategy and Governance Framework

## 🎯 Lab Goal

Develop a **lightweight AI strategy and governance model** for the Contoso Retail Group scenario from Lab 01, focusing on:

- Strategic goals and AI principles
- A simple AI solution roadmap
- Governance roles, policies, and responsible AI considerations

This lab aligns with the **“Plan AI solutions”** domain of AB‑100.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Completion of **Lab 01: Assessing AI Readiness and Opportunities** (or equivalent assessment work)
- Basic understanding of responsible AI concepts (fairness, privacy, transparency, etc.)
- Note-taking tool (Word, OneNote, Markdown, etc.)

No coding or Azure configuration is required.

---

## Step 1 – Define AI Vision and Strategic Themes

Using your findings from Lab 01, write a **brief AI vision statement** for Contoso, for example:

> "Contoso will use AI agents to deliver fast, personalized customer experiences while maintaining trust, privacy, and fairness."

Then identify **2–4 strategic themes**, such as:

- Customer experience optimization
- Operational efficiency and automation
- Data-driven decision making

Capture in a table:

| Strategic Theme | Description | Example Outcome |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Customer experience optimization | Use AI agents to reduce wait times and improve support | 20% reduction in average handle time |

---

## Step 2 – Build a Simple AI Roadmap (12–18 Months)

From your prioritized use cases in Lab 01, create a **phased roadmap**:

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Example Initiatives |
|-------|----------|-------|----------------------|
| Phase 1 | 0–3 months | Foundations & quick wins | FAQ & order status agent, AI governance kickoff |
| Phase 2 | 3–9 months | Scale customer experiences | Agent-assisted support, personalization pilot |
| Phase 3 | 9–18 months | Broader automation & insights | Returns automation, store manager insights agent |

Ensure each phase includes:

- 1–3 initiatives
- High-level success metrics (CSAT, AHT, conversion, etc.)

---

## Step 3 – Define AI Governance Structure

Design a **minimal but realistic governance model** for Contoso. Identify key roles such as:

- **AI Steering Committee** – Approves major AI initiatives and policies
- **AI Product Owner** – Owns business outcomes for a given agent/solution
- **AI Technical Lead / Architect** – Designs technical architecture and integrations
- **Compliance/Legal Representative** – Ensures regulatory and policy alignment

Capture in a table:

| Role | Responsibilities | Participants |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| AI Steering Committee | Approve roadmap, review risks, prioritize investments | CIO, Head of CX, Legal, Data Protection Officer |

Keep it practical; this is about **who does what**.

---

## Step 4 – Draft Key Governance Policies (High-Level)

For each area below, draft **2–5 bullet-point policies or guidelines**:

1. **Data & Privacy**
	- What data can be used for AI training/inference?
	- How is PII handled and protected?
2. **Model Use & Safety**
	- When must content filtering or safety systems be enabled?
	- How are harmful or biased outputs handled?
3. **Change Management**
	- Who approves changes to prompts, tools, or data sources?
	- How are major changes communicated to users?
4. **Monitoring & Incident Response**
	- What metrics are tracked (accuracy, CSAT, escalation rate)?
	- How are incidents (e.g., harmful outputs) investigated and mitigated?

You are not writing legal documents—just **clear, actionable guidelines**.

---

## Step 5 – Responsible AI Checklist for Top Use Case

Choose **one high-priority AI/agent use case** (for example, customer FAQ & order status agent) and run it through a simple **responsible AI checklist**:

Create a table like:

| Area | Questions | Notes / Actions |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Fairness | Could this agent treat some customers unfairly? | e.g., ensure language support for key markets |
| Privacy | What personal data does it access? | e.g., only last 6 months of order history |
| Transparency | Do customers know they’re interacting with an AI agent? | e.g., clear greeting and handoff to human |
| Accountability | Who owns outcomes and monitors behavior? | e.g., CX operations lead |

Add at least **one action** in each area.

---

## Step 6 – Summarize Strategy & Governance in One Page

Combine your work into a concise one‑page summary for leadership that includes:

1. **AI vision statement** and **strategic themes**
2. **Phased roadmap** with 2–3 key initiatives per phase
3. **Governance structure** (roles + responsibilities)
4. **Key policy highlights** and responsible AI considerations

This summary should be **clear enough for a non‑technical executive** to understand the direction and guardrails for AI.
